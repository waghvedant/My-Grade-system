# My-Grade-system
I've constructed a basic web-based SGPA grade calculator using Flask and Python. It is adaptable to any university. It is determined by the grading system of each college. I attempted to use the Flask framework here. It speeds up calculations and can tie html files to Python using render templating. It operates on localhost.
